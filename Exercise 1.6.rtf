\f0\fs24 \cf0 When Alyssa attempts to use new-if to compute square roots, it will be an infinite loop. Why? new-if is a compound procedure, which means that under applicative-order evaluation, the operands are evaluated before applying the procedure. The problem is that one of the operands calls sqrt-iter, which will substitute again, and again, and so forth. Since if is a special form, it bypasses this problem. The examples provided by Eva also don\'92t run into this recursion problem.}
