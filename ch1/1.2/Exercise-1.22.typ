The timing data is not able to establish a time difference
between testing primes around 1000 and 10,000. 
Instead we will try for larger numbers, such that a comparable
difference can be established.

From 10,000,000 to 100,000,000 it takes a little over 3 times
as long to test a prime, which is roughly the $sqrt(10)$ that
is expected. My machine (Macbook M4 Air) may simply be too 
powerful for the smaller intended values of this test.

Regardless, these larger numbers lend support to the 
$Theta(sqrt(n))$ prediction and is compatible with the notion 
that programs on your machine run in time proportional to the 
number of steps required for the computation.
