From Section 1.2.2 we know that the golden ratio $phi$ is
defined as $phi^2 = phi + 1$. #linebreak()
Let $x$ be $phi$, rewrite as $x^2 = x + 1$ and divide both sides by $x$ 
to get $x = 1 + 1/x$. #linebreak()
Let $f(x) = 1 + 1/x$, which means $f(x) = x$, thus $x$ is a fixed
point of the function $f$. #linebreak()
Therefore, the golden ratio $phi$ is a fixed point of the 
transformation $x mapsto 1 + 1/x$.
