The difference of two intervals can be computed by subtracting
the upper bound of the second interval from the first interval's 
lower bound, and subtracting the lower bound of the second interval 
from the first interval's upper bound. This ensures that the new 
interval captures the lowest and highest possible values of the 
difference.
